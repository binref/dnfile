        :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnfile


Parse .NET executable files.


* Free software: MIT license


Features
--------

* Parse as much as we can, even if the file is partially malformed.
* Easy to use.  Developed with IDE autocompletion in mind.


Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install dnfile

Then create a simple program that loads a .NET binary, parses it, and displays
information about the streams and Metadata Tables.

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   import dnfile

   filepath = sys.argv[1]

   pe = dnfile.dnPE(filepath)
   pe.print_info()


TODO
----

* CI
* Documentation on readthedocs
